# bfme-modding-tools

Tools I created as {IP} Gil-Galad when I was mapping &amp; modding BFME. 

These haven't been developed since around 2007, the code is basically foreign to me now! I cannot help debug or answer any questions unfortunately. But I am definitely interested in hearing if you get them up and running and fix any bugs!
